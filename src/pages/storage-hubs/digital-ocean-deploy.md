title: Configure a hub on DigitalOcean
description: 'Storing user data with Blockstack'
---

## Introduction

This teaches you how to run a Gaia storage hub on DigitalOcean (DO). DigitalOcean is an affordable and convenient cloud computing provider. This example uses DigitalOcean Spaces for file storage. A space is equivalent to AWS's S3 file storage solution.

DigitalOcean provides you with a compute machines known as a **Droplets** and storage called a **Spaces**. You need both to run a Gaia hub. The Gaia hub setup you create here, requires get a Digital Droplet with Docker pre-installed and a 250 GB Space. Droplets and storage each run for $5/month or a total of $10/month.

<h5>Is this tutorial for you?</h5>

<p>This documentation is appropriate for advanced power users who are familiar with command line tools, editing configuration files, and basic configuration of services of DNS or Nginx.</p>

<p>If you are planning on running an <em>open-membership hub</em> or an <em>application-specific hub</em>, you'll should see <a href="/storage-hubs/overview">the section on Hub Operation</a></p>.

</div>

## Prerequisites you need

You use DigitalOcean choose and configure assets for running droplets and spaces. To enable this, you must be sure to complete the prerequisites in this section.

You must create an account on <a href="https://digitalocean.com" target="\_blank">DigitalOcean</a>. DigitalOcean requires you to supply a credit card to create an account. You are only charged for the services you use the Gaia hub as of this writing should cost \$10 USD a month.

The easiest way to interact with your droplet is the DigitalOcean Console. Users who are comfortable using the secure shell (SSH) and private keys may prefer to open a local terminal on their home machine instead. To enable this, you should ensure you have the following prerequisites completed.

- Locate an existing SSH key pair on your Mac or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001736671-Creating-a-new-Key-pair-in-Mac-OS-X-or-Linux" target="\_blank">create a new SSH key pair</a>. Your key should have a passphrase, do not use a key pair without one.

- Add the <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/add-ssh-keys/to-account/" target="\_blank">SSH from your local machine to DigitalOcean</a>.

- Create a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/api/create-personal-access-token/" target="\_blank">personal access token in DigitalOcean</a>.

- Install `doctl` which is the DigitalOcean command line tool. For information on installing these, see which is the DigitalOcean command line utility. Check out their [installation instructions](https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl/blob/master/README.md#installing-doctl) to see how to install it on your computer.

## Task 1: Create a DigitalOcean space

In this task you create a **Space** which is where Gaia stores your files.

1. Choose **Create > Spaces** from the dashboard menu.

   ![Dashboard](/images/create-space.png)

2. **Choose a datacenter region** section.

   ~> Choose a region that is both geographically close to you and that supports spaces. Currently, <strong>San Francisco</strong>, <strong>New York</strong>, <strong>Amsterdam</strong>, and <strong>Singapore</strong> support spaces.

   The geographical location of your server impacts latency for storing data.
   You select a region close to you so that when you use Blockstack apps,
   storing data is quicker.

3. Scroll down to **Finalize and Create**.

4. **Choose a unique name**.

   This name is used when reading files that you've stored through Gaia. You'll need to remember this name when you set up your Gaia server later on.

5. Click **Create a Space**.

   After a moment, your Space is up and running.

## Task 2: Enable File Listing and Set a Bucket Policy

On Digital Ocean, set **Enable File Listing**:

1. Navigate to the **Spaces** tab.

2. Select your newly created space and click **Settings**
3. Set **Enable File Listing** for your space.
4. Press **Save**.

On your local workstation, create a bucket policy to grant read permission on your space.

1. On your local workstation, open a terminal.
2. <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/spaces/resources/s3cmd/" target="_blank">Install and configure the <strong>s3cmd</strong></a>.
3. In the current directory, use the `touch` command to create a file called `gaiahub-policy`.

   ```bash
   touch gaiahub-policy
   ```

4. Use your favorite editor to open the file.
5. Add the following policy to the file.

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Id": "read policy",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Sid": "PublicRead",
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": "*",
         "Action": "s3:GetObject",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<SPACE_NAME>/*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

6. Edit the `Resource` line and replace the `<SPACE_NAME>` with your space name from Digital Ocean.

   For example, if your space is named `meepers`, after editing the line you would have:

   ```
   "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::meepers/*"
   ```

   Be sure not to change any of the other fields, especially `Version`.

7. Save and close the file.
8. Use `s3cmd` to enact the policy.

   ```
   s3cmd setpolicy gaiahub-policy s3://<SPACE_NAME>
   ```

   Be sure to `SPACE_NAME` with the name of your space, for example:

   ```
   s3cmd setpolicy gaiahub-policy s3://meepers
   ```

## Task 3: Set a CORS configuration

1. On your local workstation, create a file called `gaiahub-cors.xml` that looks like this:

   ```xml
   <CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
     <CORSRule>
       <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
       <AllowedMethod>HEAD</AllowedMethod>
       <AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
       <ExposeHeader>ETag</ExposeHeader>
       <MaxAgeSeconds>0</MaxAgeSeconds>
     </CORSRule>
   </CORSConfiguration>
   ```

2. Use `s3cmd` to enact the configuration.

   ```
   s3cmd setcors gaiahub-cors.xml s3://<SPACE_NAME>
   ```

## Task 4: Create a DigitalOcean droplet

In this task, you add a droplet to your account. The droplet is a droplet is a cloud-based server you can use as a compute resource. This server is where you will run the Gaia Storage System service. The droplet you create will be an Ubuntu server with Docker pre-installed.

1. Log into DigitalOcean.
2. Go to your DigitalOcean dashboard.

   ![Dashboard](/images/digital-welcome.png)

3. Click the **Create > Droplets** button in the top right.

   ![Create option](/images/digital-droplet.png)

4. Select the **Marketplace** tab.

   ![Marketplace](/images/digital-one-click.png)

5. Select the **Docker** app from the options presented.

6. Scroll down to the **Choose a size** section and use the left arrow to display and select the **\$5/mo** image.

   This size gives you plenty of memory and disk space to run a personal hub.

7. Scroll down to the **Choose a datacenter region** section.

   ~> Choose a region that is both geographically close to you and that supports spaces. Currently, <strong>San Francisco</strong>, <strong>New York</strong>, <strong>Amsterdam</strong>, and <strong>Singapore</strong> support spaces.

   The geographical location of your server impacts latency for storing data. You select a region close to you so that when you use Blockstack apps, storing data is quicker.

8. If you are using SSH, scroll to the **Add your SSH key** section and choose an SSH key to use. Otherwise,

9. Scroll down to the **Finalize and create** section.

10. **Choose a hostname** for your droplet such as `moxie-gaiahub`.

11. Review your choices then click **Create** to start your droplet running.

At this point, your new droplet should appear in the list of resources on your DigitalOcean dashboard.

## Task 5: Open a console on your Droplet

A droplet console emulates the access you would have if you were sitting down with a keyboard and monitor attached to the actual server. In this section, you open a console on your droplet.

-> If you are an SSH user and have completed the prerequisites, <strong>skip this section</strong>. Instead, use [the DigitalOcean instructions for connecting with doctl](https://do.co/2S4HMk1).

1. From the DigitalOcean dashboard, select Droplets.

   You should see the droplet you just created.

2. Click on the droplet name to open the control panel.

   ![Droplet control panel](/images/droplet-control.png)

3. Choose **Access** from the control panel.
4. Select **Reset Root Password** to have DigitalOcean send you the root password.

   DigitalOcean sends a temporary password to the email attached to your account. It takes a couple of minutes to reset the root password on your droplet.

5. Open your email and copy the password.
6. Switch back to the droplet control panel and choose **Launch Console**.

   A new window with the console appears.

7. Enter `root` for the login.
8. Paste the password copied from your email.

   The system displays a message telling you to change the `root` password.

   ![Droplet control panel](/images/droplet-control.png)

   And prompts you for the current password.

9. Past the password copied from your email again.

   The system prompts you for a new password and ask you to enter it again.

10. Provide and confirm a new password.

    The system logins you in and gives you a welcome message. At the conclusion of the message, you are at the console prompt.

    ```
    Welcome to DigitalOcean's One-Click Docker Droplet.
    To keep this Droplet secure, the UFW firewall is enabled.
    All ports are BLOCKED except 22 (SSH), 2375 (Docker) and 2376 (Docker).

<p>If you find the output from ls difficult to read, try enter the following to change the console colors from the command line: <code>LS_COLORS="di=1&semi;31"</code> You can also edit your console <code>.bashrc</code>. file permanently, of course.</p>
</div>

## Task 6: Create a space key

1. In the DigitalOcean dashboard, go to the **API** page.
2. Scroll to the **Spaces Access Keys** section.
3. Click **Generate New Key**.

   The system prompts you to give the key a name.

4. Enter a name for the key.

   It is helpful to choose descriptive name like `gai-hub-key`.

5. Press the check mark.

   The system creates your key and displays both the key and its secret.

   ![Access key](/images/space-access-key.png)

6. Save your secret in a secure password manager.

   You should never share your secret.

7. Leave the page up with your key and secret and go to your open console.

## Task 7: Get the Gaia code and configure your server

You should have the console open as `root` on your Droplet. In this section, you get the Gaia code and configure the Gaia service.

1. Copy the Gaia code into your droplet using the `git clone` command.

   ```
   root@meepers:~# git clone https://github.com/blockstack/gaia.git
   ```

   Successful output from this command looks like the following.

   ```
   Cloning into 'gaia'...
   remote: Enumerating objects: 63, done.
   remote: Counting objects: 100% (63/63), done.
   remote: Compressing objects: 100% (46/46), done.
   remote: Total 4206 (delta 27), reused 35 (delta 17), pack-reused 4143
   Receiving objects: 100% (4206/4206), 17.40 MiB | 9.89 MiB/s, done.
   Resolving deltas: 100% (2700/2700), done.
   root@meepers:~#
   ```

   This command creates a `gaia` subdirectory.

2. Change to `hub` directory in the `gaia` code.

   ```
   cd gaia/hub
   ```

3. Copy the configuration sample to a new `config.json` file.

   ```
   cp config.do.sample.json config.json
   ```

4. Edit your new `config.json` file with `vi` or `vim`.

   ```
   vi config.json
   ```

   You now need to edit this JSON file to have it store files on your DigitalOcean space.

   ```
   {
    "serverName": "DROPLET_NAME",
    "port": 4000,
    "driver": "aws",
    "readURL": "SPACE_URL",
    "proofsConfig": {
      "proofsRequired": 0
    },
    "pageSize": 20,
    "bucket": "SPACE_NAME",
    "awsCredentials": {
       "endpoint": "SPACE_LOCATION",
       "accessKeyId": "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY",
       "secretAccessKey": ""
    },
    "argsTransport": {
      "level": "debug",
      "handleExceptions": true,
      "stringify": true,
      "timestamp": true,
      "colorize": false,
      "json": true
    }
   }
   ```

````

 You'll find that the `driver` is set to `aws`. The DigitalOcean space API exactly mimics the S3 API. Since Gaia doesn't have a DigitalOcean driver, you can just use the `aws` driver with some special configuration.

5. Set the `serverName` to the droplet you just created.
6. Set the `readURL` to the URL of the DigitalOcean space you just created.

 If your space URL called `https://meepers-hub-space.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com `, the `readURL` name is `https://meepers-hub-space.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com`.
7. Set the `bucket` to the name of the DigitalOcean space you just created.

 If your space is called `meepers-hub-space`, the `bucket` value is `meepers-hub-space`.

8.  Go back to your DigitalOcean dashboard open to your space key.
9.  Copy the **Key** and paste it into the `accessKeyId` value in the `config.json` file.
10. Copy the **Secret** and paste it into the `secretAccessKey` value in the `config.json` file.
11. In the DigitalOcean dashboard, choose the Spaces page.
12. Copy the section of your space URL that follows the name.

  ![Space endpoint](/images/space-endpoint.png)

  In this example, you would copy the `sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com` section.

13. Paste the string you copied into the `endpoint` value.

14. Ensure the `proofsRequired` value is set to the number `0` (zero).

  This will allow Blockstack user to write to your Gaia hub, without any social proofs required. You can change this later on, and do other things to lock-down this Gaia hub to just yourself, but that is outside the scope of this document.

  At this point, the `json.config` file should be completed and appear similar to the following &&mdash;; but with your values.

  ```json
  {
    "serverName": "moxie-gaiahub",
    "port": 4000,
    "driver": "aws",
    "readURL": "https://meepers-hub-space.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com",
    "proofsConfig": {
        "proofsRequired": 0
    },
    "pageSize": 20,
    "bucket": "meepers-hub-space",
    "awsCredentials": {
      "endpoint": "sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com",
      "accessKeyId": "fb3J7AT/PGMGMPOA86EFLpx8IjGZQib99eXWjVR+QK0",
      "secretAccessKey": "9ac685342eaa5bc4b44c13f3ecf43b001a3bdb9e2257114d44394d410dd91f66"
    },
    "argsTransport": {
      "level": "debug",
      "handleExceptions": true,
      "stringify": true,
      "timestamp": true,
      "colorize": false,
      "json": true
    }
  }
````

15. Save your config file and close the `vim` editor.

The system returns you back to the prompt.

## Task 8: Run the Gaia image with Docker

While your console is still in the the `gaia/hub` folder, build the `gaia.hub` image.

1. Enter the following `docker` command at the console command line.

```

docker build -t gaia.hub .

```

This build users the `Dockerfile` already in the `gaia/hub` folder. The output of the command is similar to the following:

```

....

npm WARN gaia-hub@2.3.4 No license field.
npm WARN optional SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: fsevents@1.2.4 (node_modules/fsevents):
npm WARN notsup SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: Unsupported platform for fsevents@1.2.4: wanted {"os":"darwin","arch":"any"} (current: {"os":"linux","arch":"x64"})

```

2. Run your Gaia hub image.

```bash
docker run --restart=always -v ~/gaia/hub/config.json:/src/hub/config.json -p 3000:3000 -e CONFIG_PATH=/src/hub/config.json gaia.hub
```

This runs your Gaia hub on port `3000`. If everything runs successfully, the last line outputted from this command should be:

    ```bash
    Successfully compiled 13 files with Babel.
    {"level":"warn","message":"Listening on port 3000 in development mode","timestamp":"2019-01-23T16:35:05.216Z"}
    ```

3. If your command did run successfully, stop the service using the hotkey `ctrl-c`.

4. Run the the image again with this new command.

   ```
   docker run --restart=always -v ~/gaia/hub/config.json:/src/hub/config.json -p 3000:3000 -e CONFIG_PATH=/src/hub/config.json -d gaia.hub
   ```

   This command includes `-d` option to `docker run`. This runs Docker in detached mode, so that it runs in the background. You can run `docker ps` to see your running docker images, and get the `id` of your Gaia server.

   ```bash
   root@meepers:~/gaia/hub# docker ps
   CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
   aeca7eea4a86        gaia.hub            "npm run start"     11 seconds ago      Up 10 seconds       0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp   musing_payne
   ```

At this point, your Gaia service is up and running. You can run `docker logs MY_CONTAINER_ID` with your running image's ID to see the logs of this server at any time.

## Task 9: Set up an Nginx reverse proxy

In this task, you set up a simple Nginx reverse proxy to serve your Docker container through a public URL. You do this from the droplet console command line.

1. Install nginx into the droplet.

   ```
   sudo apt-get install nginx
   ```

2. Enter `y` to confirm the installation.
3. Edit the nginx default configuration file.

   ```
   vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
   ```

4. Inside the `location /` block (line 48), enter the following configuration:

   ```nginx
   location / {
          proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
          proxy_http_version 1.1;
          proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
          proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
          proxy_set_header Host $host;
          proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;

          if ($request_method = 'OPTIONS') {
                    more_set_headers   'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *';
                    more_set_headers   'Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS, DELETE';
                    more_set_headers   'Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, authorization, If-Match';
                    more_set_headers   'Access-Control-Max-Age: 21600';
                    more_set_headers   'Content-Type: text/plain charset=UTF-8';
                    more_set_headers   'Content-Length: 0';
                    return             204;
          }
          more_set_headers    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *';
    }
   ```

   This simple configuration passes all requests through to your Gaia hub running at port `3000`.

5. Save and close the file.
6. Run `nginx -t` to make sure you have no syntax errors.

   ```
   root@meepers:~/gaia/hub# nginx -t
   nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
   nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
   ```

7. Restart `nginx` with your new configuration.

   ```
   systemctl restart nginx
   ```

8. Allow access to your Gaia hub by exposing port 80 to the public.

   ```
   ufw allow 80
   ```

## Task 10: Test your Gaia server

Now, you are ready to test your Gaia server and make sure it is up and running.

1. Click on **Droplets** in the sidebar.
2. Find your Droplet running Gaia.

   ![Droplet IP](/images/space-endpoint.png)

3. Copy the IP address for it.
4. In your browser, visit the page `MY_DROPLET_IP/hub_info`.

   You should see a response from your Gaia hub!

   ![Hub test](/images/hub-running.png)

   The `read_url_prefix` should be combine from the bucket and endpoint create
   in your `config.json` file, for example,
   `https://meepers-hub-space.s3.amazonaws.com/`.

## Task 11: Configure a domain name

At this point, you can point a domain to your Gaia hub. Although it's not required, it is highly recommended. If you use a domain, you can migrate your Droplet to a different server (or even provider such as Azure or AWS) at any time, and still access it through the domain URL. Simply point your domain at the IP address for your Droplet. Use an `A Record` DNS type.

These instructions assume you have already created a free <a href="https://www.freenom.com" target="\_blank">domain through the freenom service</a>. To point this freenom domain to your Gaia hub, do the following:

1. Log into your freenom account.
2. Choose the **Manage Freenom Domain** tab.
3. Add an **A** record leave the **Name** field blank.

   This record points your entire domain to the hub IP.

4. Save your changes.

5. Create a CNAME record.

   For example, you can use the prefix `www` with your domain name. When you are done, your

6. Save your changes.

   At this point, your DNS management should look similar to the following except that with your domain rather than the `maryhub.ga` domain.

   ![DNS fields](/images/dns-fields.png)

7. After your changes propagate, visit your new domain at the `hub_info` page.

   ![Domain test](/images/domain-test.png)

## Task 12: Set up SSL

If you've configured a domain to point to your Gaia hub, then it's highly
recommended that you set up SSL to connect to your hub securely. DigitalOcean
provides <a
href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-18-04"
target="\_blank">how to setup SSL </a>. Follow those instructions, to setup SSL.
When completed, you'll be able to visit `https://mygaiadomain.com/hub_info`
securely.
